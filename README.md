<h1>Cubing Assignment </h> <br> <br>

<p>Prior to going into Mr O's computer science class, I had little knowledge on cube algorithims and how to solve them. I have to admit that I am still a beginner in the process as I am still learning more efficient methods on some of the simplest cubes. So as of right now, the only cube I can solve quickly is the Pyraminx Duo.

Type of cube: Pyraminx Duo
Can I solve it: Yes
Method for solving: Finding the common side that all colors share
